_Blowup_ UK, Italy| 1966 | 35mm |111 min. <br>
Director: Michelangelo Antonioni <br>
Cast: David Hemmings, Vanessa Redgrave, Sarah Miles <br>
Hemmings is a fashion photographer who takes a stroll through a London park for a
few snapshots, but do his images of a lovers’ lunchtime tryst also offer clues to a
murder? Perhaps the ultimate statement on fear and alienation in the big city,
Antonioni’s international box office smash was a taboo breaker in terms of full
frontal nudity, as well as a gripping existential mystery. The score is by Herbie
Hancock and The Yardbirds (featuring Jimmy Page) appear in a memorable party
scene.
